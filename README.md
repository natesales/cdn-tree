# Packetframe Control Plane v3

Version 3 of the Packetframe CDN control plane. This is an incomplete experiment - for the real, currently-deployed code, see https://github.com/packetframe/cdn

### Development

Set `CDNV3_DEVELOPMENT=true` to enable local development mode of the API. Dev mode disables MongoDB from expecting a replica set, and enables more verbose logging.

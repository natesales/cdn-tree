The Edge Cache Appliance (ECA) program brings PacketFrame content as close to your users as possible by deploying an anycast node directly in your network. ECAs are designed to run in a wide variety of environments, even those behind firewalls with limited external access. Requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and involve specific technical and policy requirements. Depending on the scenario, ECAs are available as dedicated hardware as well as VM images. Networks that wish to have PacketFrame content with the lowest possible latency can opt to host an EOS server for the full DNS or HTTP(S) traffic. EOS are fully managed by PacketFrame and can be run on a VM or dedicated server. EOS nodes to the host network via BGP and announce routes based on instructions from the PacketFrame control plane.
